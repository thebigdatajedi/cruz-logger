A service class is typically a class that provides a set of methods or functions that perform specific tasks related to a particular domain or use case. Service classes are often used to encapsulate business logic or other functionality that is specific to a particular part of an application. Examples of service classes might include classes that provide database access functions, network communication functions, or user authentication functions. - So, the key is that they are application domain specific functions as opposed to utility classes that provide more generic function that is applicable to ANY application domain.
